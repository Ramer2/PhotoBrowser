# Photo Browser

This is my project for Java Swing topic in my university.

The task was to create a program, that allows for adding and removing photos. These photos should be able to have tags (which are managed separately). 
Also the programm should allow to change the data of the photo.

The program should allow to manage collections of photos.

The program should be able to search through photos by tags, words from descriptions and names.

For this implementation I got 90% of the points (thanks Mr. Werner).
